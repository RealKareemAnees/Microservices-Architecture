# Microservices Architecture with Patterns and Principles

this could be the most comprehensive guide for microserviecs architecure design from a high level POV

I made this in a progressive manner, solving problems and refactoring (migrating) from monolithic to modular monolithic to microservices then to serverless

this guide focuses only on the serverside, another guid will be released for _Micro Frontends_ that discusses clientside architecture

If you want more follow me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kareem-anees-0496b62b3) where I post updates

this is a follow up with cuorse by _Mohamad Ozkaya_ on _O'reilly_
